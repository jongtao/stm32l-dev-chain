STM32L Discovery Development

Provides a STM32L-Discovery compatible sample code and libraries. This is a heavily altered version of the materials for the wolinlabs STM32 Linux development tutorial (which used the STM32LF4).


Contents
---------

* LED blinker sample code (buildable)
* STM libraries and headers



Prerequisites
--------------
* [GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors Toolchain](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) (Compiler)
* [STLINK](https://github.com/texane/stlink) (Programmer)
